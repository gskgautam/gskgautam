# üí´ About Me:
Currently, a PhD student at Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia), Gautam is passionate about innovation and solving real-world challenges through cutting-edge technologies. In his PhD journey, Gautam is driven by the potential of LLM alignment to create socially beneficial AI systems that are robust, explainable, and aligned with human values. This research intersects with his ongoing interests in machine learning applications, secure computing, and metaheuristic optimization, paving the way for impactful contributions in AI ethics, multimodal systems, and practical AI adoption in critical fields.

Born and raised in New Delhi, India, he has always demonstrated a strong inclination toward learning and self-improvement. His entrepreneurial mindset and creative problem-solving approach drive him to seek unconventional solutions to complex optimization problems, particularly in the realms of metaheuristic optimization and explainable AI. Gautam earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with the highest GPA in his class and completed a Master's degree in Computer Applications. His Master‚Äôs thesis on optimizing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training using metaheuristics was published, reflecting his exceptional research capabilities. With a diverse portfolio of publications, his work has been featured in SCI, ESCI, and Scopus-indexed journals Additionally, he has co-authored several book chapters published by CRC Press and Springer. His innovative methodologies have been presented at high-impact conferences such as ICASSP (IEEE), EUSIPCO (IEEE), Interspeech, and NAACL, reflecting his contributions to machine learning applications and multimodal analysis.
