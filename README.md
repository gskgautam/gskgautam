## üí° About Me

Gautam Siddharth Kashyap is a PhD researcher at Macquarie University specializing in the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the HHH framework‚ÄîHelpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty. His doctoral research focuses on developing principled methods to align LLMs with human values, leading to publications at EMNLP, etc.

Starting with a strong foundation in computational intelligence and optimization, Gautam graduated top of his class with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, completing a thesis on ‚ÄúVehicle Routing Optimization for Supply Chain Management Using RWPSO (Roulette Wheel Particle Swarm Optimization)‚Äù, followed by a Master‚Äôs in Computer Applications (MCA) with a thesis titled ‚ÄúOptimizing Artificial Neural Network Training Using Metaheuristics: A Comparative Study of PSO, Genetic Algorithms, and PSO‚ÄìStochastic Gradient Descent.‚Äù These works laid the foundation for his SCI, ESCI, and Scopus-indexed publications and book chapters with CRC Press and Springer.

Beyond his doctoral research, Gautam also contributes to NLP for social good, focusing on the development of ethical, inclusive, and reliable AI systems. His work has been presented at leading venues such as IEEE TAI, EMNLP, NAACL, Interspeech, IEEE ICASSP, IEEE EUSIPCO, ASONAM, WISE, IGARSS, and Soft Computing. In addition to his research, Gautam actively serves the academic community as a peer reviewer for several top-tier journals and conferences, including ACL ARR, The Web Conference (WebConf), IJCNN, Journal of Big Data, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Complex & Intelligent Systems, Computers & Electrical Engineering, Pattern Recognition Letters, and Natural Language Engineering.
